## SOLID Principles Examples in PHP
## every principle has it's own file
### Single Responsibility Principle ([Example](./1-single-responsibility-principle.php))
This principle is about **actors and high level architecture**.
> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### Open Closed Principle ([Example](./2-open-closed-principle.php))
This principle is about **class design and feature extensions**.
> A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle ([Example](./3-liskov-substitution-principle.php))
This principle is about **subtyping and inheritance**
> Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle ([Example](./4-interface-segregation-principle.php))
This principle is about **business logic to clients communication**.
> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion Principle ([Example](./5-dependency-inversion-principle.php))
This principle wires up all **other four principles in a single circle**.
> Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
